## Installation Instructions

### Install Python

### Install Packages

Installing required packages using "pip"

Open your terminal and check whether you have the "pip" function installed by typing pip (and enter)
If you do not have pip installed, check the link: [https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/) (If installing via the terminal/command line, ensure you are in the directory where you have downloaded the file "get-pip" or if using chrome right-click on the link to download, save to desktop, and simply double click on the executable).

You may need to use `sudo pip install` (for OSX, nix, etc) or run your command shell as Administrator (for Windows) to be able to perform the installation of the folllowing individual packages:

    (sudo) pip install pandas
    (sudo) pip install Plotly

If you already have any of the previously-mentioned libraries installed, you can update them to a newer version using the syntax:

    pip install <package> --upgrade

where `<package>` can be any of the libraries mentioned above.

Also install the Jupyter notebook (formerly ipython notebook) with:

    conda install jupyter

You should now be all setup.
